<p>
An additional point is awarded to the driver with the fastest lap, but the driver needs to finish in the top 10 to collect that point.
</p>
<p>
For the sprint, additional points will be on offer for the top eight drivers, with the winner earning eight points. P2 through P8 will earn seven, six, five, four, three, two and one point, respectively.
</p>
<p>
For 2022, a new points system has been introduced for races halted during the Grand Prix due to an incident, bad weather or a situation where a race can't go ahead. This was a reaction to the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, where the race was canceled after two laps because of torrential rain and half-points were awarded.
</p>
<ul>
<li> 
No points will be awarded unless the minimum of two laps have been completed under green flag conditions.
</li>
<li>
Points will be awarded on a 6–4–3–2–1 basis to the top five if less than 25 percent of the race is completed.
</li>
<li>
Points will be awarded on a 13–10–8–6–5–4–3–2–1 basis to the top nine if between 25 percent and 50 percent of the race is completed.
</li>
<li>
Points will be awarded on a 19–14–12–9–8–6–5–3–2–1 basis to the top 10 if 50 percent to 75 percent of the race is completed.
</li>
<li>
If more than 75 percent of the scheduled race distance is completed, then full points will be awarded to the top 10.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The points are added up over the course of the season and go toward the drivers' and constructors' championship. The driver and team with the most points at the end of the season are crowned champions.
