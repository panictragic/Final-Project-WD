If you’re new to Formula 1, now is the perfect time to join in the fun.
</p>
<p>
Following from the thrilling end to 2021, which saw Max Verstappen win his first world championship in controversial fashion on the final lap of the final race, the interest around the 2022 season is huge. Verstappen is once more vying for supremacy but, this time, it's Ferrari rather than Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton who are proving his biggest challenge.
</p>
<p>
The sport is set for another year of drama, with new cars and regulations in place to create more action and produce closer racing with a revolution in aerodynamics around the cars.

<h1>
What is Formula 1?
</h1>

<p>
Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsport and the highest class of single-seater racing. F1 races with open-wheel cars, and on both permanent race tracks and street circuits. F1 visits traditional racing hotspots such as the UK, Monaco, Italy and Belgium every season and has recently ventured into new territories such as Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Azerbaijan 
(See full 2022 schedule <a href="schedule.html">here</a>). 
</p>
<p>
F1 has a competition structure that involves 10 <a href="teams.html">teams</a>, with two drivers per team. It is effectively a league table format, with points racked up over the course of the season (Read more on how points are rewarded <a href="points.html">here</a> and view current team and driver rankings <a href="rankings.html">here</a> ). 

</p>
<p>
The world championship was founded in 1950 and is sanctioned by the FIA, which sets the rules and regulations. The sport is unique as teams build their own distinct cars every year, following the rules and regulations set by the FIA. Often they create cars with high cornering speeds. On average, F1 cars generate a top speed over 200 mph (320 kph) on the straights.
</p>
<p>
Over its 70-year history, Formula 1 has been known to be a dangerous sport, with the drivers risking their lives while racing. Over recent decades, safety has improved drastically with car modifications — such as the halo over the cockpit — to protect the drivers.
